        <p>Have you heard about the glowing blue tides? Certain beaches like Maldives, San Diego and Puerto Rico glow blue at night. Just maybe Harry Potter cast a spell on the waters. I hoped so too,
             but this surreal effect is caused by bioluminescent phytoplankton and jellyfish.</p>
        </aside>
<p style="font-size:150%">Marina beach is full of activity in the early morning hours and in the evenings. Walking along the beaches during sunrise and sunset is a pleasant experience for all. In the evening this beach becomes a fair ground with numerous stalls selling artifacts, handcrafted showpieces, ethnic jewelry, and food items. Children play games and frolic around.

    Going into the sea should be done under expert guidance as the undercurrent is strong. Flying kites and pony riding are popular activities on this beach.</p>
